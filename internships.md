# Where could I try to get a cs internship over the summer?

A variety of companies offer internships, especially in CS.
The following lists out potential employers in no particular order.

## General Thoughts

Most large companies offer some form of computer science internship, especially companies that deal with engineering.

### Apps
If you're interested in mobile apps, think of your most-used apps and search the company website (ex. SnapChat, Pinterest, etc.)

### Security / Military
If you're interested in security or the military, look for government positions through NSA, CIA, DoD, etc.

### Health / Medicine
If you're interested in health or medicine, look for positions with hospitals or NGOs (ex. Beaumont, UM Health System, St. Johns, Red Cross). You might also consider working for companies that supply medical equipment (ex. Stryker, Zimmer-Biomet, Medtronic, Dexcom, Epic).

### Gaming
If you're interested in gaming, consider game development companies. Note that not all game development companies are focused on hiring game developers explicitly! Some companies hire interns to become data scientists and study how the game is played and used, not just to program the game itself. (Ex. Blizzard, DICE, Electronic Arts, Riot Games).

### Automotive
The automotive industry also hires many CS interns and not just in the Michigan's "Big Three" (Ford, FCA, GM).
Consider other companies like Honda, Toyota, Kia, etc.

Suppliers to automotive companies are also good places to look! (Ex. Delphi, Denso, Bosch, Magna, ZF, Hyundai Mobis, Lear)

### Big Tech
As always, there are the larger tech companies. (Ex. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft).
